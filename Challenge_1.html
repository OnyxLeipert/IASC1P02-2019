<h1>Canada</h1>
<br />
<h3>Etymology</h3>
<br />
<p>While a <em>variety</em> of <em>theories</em> have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now
  accepted as coming from St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning "<em>village</em>" or "<em>settlement</em>".[9] In
  1535, indiginous inhabitants of present-day Quebec city region used the word to direct French explorer
  Jaques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[10] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that
  particular village, but the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief of Stadacona);[10] by 1545, European
  books and maps had begun reffering to this region as Canada.[10]

  In the 17th and early 18th centuries, "<strong>Canada</strong>" reffered to the part of New France that lay along the St.
  Lawrence River.[11] In 1791, the area become two british colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada
  Collectively named The Canadas; until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[12] Upon
  Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country, and the word Dominion
  was conffered as the country's title.[13] The transition away from the use of Dominion was formally reflected in
  1982 with the passage of the Canada Act, which refers only to Canada. Later that year, the national holiday
  was renamed from Dominion Day to <strong>Canada Day</strong>.[14] The term "Dominion" is also used to distinguish the
  federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term "federal" had replaced "dominion".[15]

  <h3>History</h3>
  <br />
  <p>
  <strong>Aboriginal peoples</strong>
  Aboriginal peoples in present-day Canada include the <em>First Nations, Inuit, and MÃ©tis</em>,[16] the latter being a
  mixed blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when <strong>First Nations</strong> and Inuit people married
  Ueropean settlers.[16] Archaelogical studies and genetic analyses have indicated a human presence in
  the northern Yukon region from 13,000-12,000 BC and in southern Ontario from 7500 BC.[17][18] These First
  settlers entered Canada through Beringia by way of Bering land bridge.[19]

  <strong>Ueropean colonization</strong>
  The first known attempt at European colonization began when Norsemen settled briefly at L'Anse aux
  Meadows in Newfoundland around 1000 AD.[32] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when
  Italian seafarer <em>John Cabot</em> explored Canada's Atlantic coast for England.[33] Then Basque and Portuguese
  mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast in early 16th
  century.[34] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the <strong>St. Lawrence River</strong>, wjere on July 24, <head>
    planted a 10-metre(33 ft) cross bearing the words "Long Live the King of France" and took possesion of the territory in the name of King Francis I.[35]
